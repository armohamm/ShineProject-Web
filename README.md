# ShineProject-Web
Stay organised by creating to-do lists to help you finish what matters.

ShineProject is a modern web application which allows end users to create to-do lists to stay organised. This is a personal project which i have decided to put on GitHub.
  - This repository contains the VueJS single page application which is hosted at <https://shineproject.io>
  - This isn't a project intended to make any money, its just to provide a free service and be a good place to try out new technology.
  - I am in the process of transitioning this repository from BitBucket
  - It is my intention to host the WEB and API together in a single repository, but at the moment they are seperate repositories.

## Sister repository
 1. You can access the .NETCore Web API at <https://github.com/tommcclean/ShineProject-Api>
 2. You can access review the endpoints available on the hosted API at <https://api.shineproject.io/swagger>

## How to contribute
 1. This repository and its sister are open for contributions.
 2. You can contribute by documenting issues or feature requests, or by forking the repository and pushing pull requests.
 3. Your pull requests might be improvements to my architecture or code, performance optimisations or new features.
 4. I might look at creating a native mobile app in future, so if you are an aspiring app developer, maybe you want to create a native app client of the API?

## Notes
- I am in the process of reviewing this code base, to bring it in line with best practices, its robust and performant, but some areas need a little bit of work to reduce  the code footprint and improve resiliency if the API were to go down or encounter a breaking change.
